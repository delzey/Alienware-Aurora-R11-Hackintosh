# Alienware-Aurora-R11-Hackintosh
 Full working OpenCore version for 10th Gen Intel and macOS
 
 My machine: Alienware Aurora R11 with i9-10900KF, 32GB memory, RX 580, 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD, DW1830 wifi+bluetooth
 
 This is a collection of files that worked for me. The credit for them go to the resources used over time to compile something thst worked for me. The config.plist was updated using ProperTree.
 
Some issues:
  - Killer Wi-Fi AX1650 - did not work (Changed to Fenvi FV-T919 then to DW1830)
  - Hynix 1Tb NVMe SSD did not work (Changed to 970 Evo Plus)
  - Bluetooth not working properly (Not much time spent in troubleshooting)
  
BIOS Settings:
 - Reset to Default
 - Reset NVRAM on first boot (Use Opencore)
